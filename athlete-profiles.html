										<p>Alisa started cheer during her second year at University and has completely changed her life.</p>
										<p>After 2 years on Durham Divas All-Girl Level 3 squad she moved to Newcastle to start my medical degree.<br/>A previous coach invited Alisa to attend a few REIGN ALLSTAR sessions to give Level 5 a go and also help them out during the season.
										<p>Alisa never dreamt she'd ever make it onto a Worlds squad and it means so much to her to be able to go with the Reign family.</p>
										<blockquote>"Cheer has provided me with so much over the last few years giving me some of my best friends and greatest memories. It’s amazing what you can achieve with hard work and people who believe in you.""</blockquote>

										<blockquote>"I feel that cheerleading creates strong bonds and friendships that will last forever. My cheerleading friends are people, which I refer to as my sisters and understand me better than anyone else. Cheerleading has helped me through so much over the years and helped me discover who I really am and what I love you do."</blockquote>
